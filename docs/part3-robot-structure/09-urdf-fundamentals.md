# URDF: Unified Robot Description Format

> **Learning Goal**: Understand URDF as the standard robot structure format, how it describes joints and links, and how ROS 2 tools use it.

## Overview

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** is an XML-based file format for describing robot structure:

- **Links**: Rigid bodies (parts of the robot)
- **Joints**: Connections between links (where they move)
- **Sensors**: Cameras, IMUs, force sensors
- **Actuators**: Motors that move joints

*This section is an outline. Full content to be added: URDF XML structure, link and joint definitions, inertia and collision geometry.*
