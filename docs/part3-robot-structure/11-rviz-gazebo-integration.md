# Visualization and Simulation: RViz and Gazebo

> **Learning Goal**: Load robot URDF in RViz for visualization and Gazebo for physics simulation. Understand real hardware vs. simulation.

## Overview

Once you have a URDF, you can:

- **RViz**: Visualize the robot structure and sensor data in 3D
- **Gazebo**: Simulate physics, joint constraints, and sensor behavior
- **Control**: Command joints via ROS 2 published messages

*This section is an outline. Full content to be added: Loading URDF in RViz, joint state visualization, Gazebo physics setup, real hardware adaptation.*
