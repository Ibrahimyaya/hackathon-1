# Agent-Controller Pattern for Humanoid Control

> **Learning Goal**: See how Topics, Services, and Actions work together in a realistic humanoid control system.

## Overview

The **agent-controller pattern** is how humanoid robots are typically structured:

- **Agent** (planning): Decides what the robot should do
- **Controller** (low-level control): Executes motor commands
- Communication: Topics, Services, Actions

*This section is an outline. Full content to be added: End-to-end humanoid example showing planning → control → motor execution.*
