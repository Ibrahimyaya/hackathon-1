# Actions: Asynchronous Task Execution

> **Learning Goal**: Learn asynchronous communication for long-running tasks (move to pose, reach target) with feedback.

## Overview

**Actions** enable long-running asynchronous tasks with periodic feedback. A goal sender requests a goal, the goal executor runs the task, and sends feedback and final result.

*This section is an outline. Full content to be added: Action concept, goal/feedback/result, executor example, humanoid motion planning example.*
