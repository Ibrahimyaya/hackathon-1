# Topics: Asynchronous Publish-Subscribe Communication

> **Learning Goal**: Master the fundamental ROS 2 communication pattern for streaming data (sensor readings, motor commands).

## Overview

**Topics** are named channels where nodes publish and subscribe to messages. Publishers and subscribers are completely decoupled—they don't know about each other.

*This section is an outline. Full content to be added: Topic concept, publisher/subscriber example, message types, QoS settings for high-frequency sensors.*
